Although machine learning algorithms have been successfully applied to a large number of genomic sequence-related problems, the results are largely affected by the type and number of features extracted. This effect has motivated new algorithms and pipeline proposals, mainly involving feature extraction problems, in which extracting significant discriminatory information from a biological set is challenging. Considering this, our work proposes a new study of feature extraction approaches based on mathematical features (numerical mapping with Fourier, entropy and complex networks). As a case study, we analyze long non-coding RNA sequences. Moreover, we separated this work into three studies. First, we assessed our proposal with the most addressed problem in our review, e.g. lncRNA and mRNA; second, we also validate the mathematical features in different classification problems, to predict the class of lncRNA, e.g. circular RNAs sequences; third, we analyze its robustness in scenarios with imbalanced data. The experimental results demonstrated three main contributions: first, an in-depth study of several mathematical features; second, a new feature extraction pipeline; and third, its high performance and robustness for distinct RNA sequence classification.

	Abstract = {A substantial fraction of the human transcriptome is composed of the so-called long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), yet the available catalogs of known lncRNAs are far from complete. Moreover, functional studies of these RNAs are challenged by several factors, such as their tissue-specific expression and functional heterogeneity, resulting in only ca. 1\% of them being well characterized. Here, we describe a set of 41,400 novel lncRNAs discovered with RNA-Seq data from 1463 samples encompassing diverse tissues and cell lines. We utilized publicly available transcriptomic and genomic data to provide their characteristics, such as tissue specificity, cellular abundance, polyA status, cellular localization, evolutionary conservation and transcript stability, which allowed us to speculate on their possible biological roles. We also pinpointed 24 novel lncRNAs as candidates for breast cancer biomarkers. The results bring us closer to a comprehensive annotation of human lncRNAs, though vast amounts of further work are needed to validate the predictions and fully decipher their biology.

abstract = {Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are a new type of non-coding RNAs and are closely related with the occurrence and development of diseases. In previous studies, most lincRNAs have been identified through next-generation sequencing. Because lincRNAs exhibit tissue-specific expression, the reproducibility of lincRNA discovery in different studies is very poor. In this study, not including lincRNA expression, we used the sequence, structural and protein-coding potential features as potential features to construct a classifier that can be used to distinguish lincRNAs from non-lincRNAs. The GA–SVM algorithm was performed to extract the optimized feature subset. Compared with several feature subsets, the five-fold cross validation results showed that this optimized feature subset exhibited the best performance for the identification of human lincRNAs. Moreover, the LincRNA Classifier based on Selected Features (linc-SF) was constructed by support vector machine (SVM) based on the optimized feature subset. The performance of this classifier was further evaluated by predicting lincRNAs from two independent lincRNA sets. Because the recognition rates for the two lincRNA sets were 100\% and 99.8\%, the linc-SF was found to be effective for the prediction of human lincRNAs.}

Feature extraction techniques capable of extracting numerical information from biological sequences have been reported in the literature. However, many of these techniques are not available in existing packages, such as mathematical descriptors. This paper presents a new package, MathFeature, which implements mathematical descriptors able to extract relevant numerical information from biological sequences, i.e. DNA, RNA and proteins (prediction of structural features along the primary sequence of amino acids). MathFeature makes available 20 numerical feature extraction descriptors based on approaches found in the literature, e.g. multiple numeric mappings, genomic signal processing, chaos game theory, entropy and complex networks. MathFeature also allows the extraction of alternative features, complementing the existing packages. To ensure that our descriptors are robust and to assess their relevance, experimental results are presented in nine case studies. According to these results, the features extracted by MathFeature showed high performance (0.6350–0.9897, accuracy), both applying only mathematical descriptors, but also hybridization with well-known descriptors in the literature. Finally, through MathFeature, we overcame several studies in eight benchmark datasets, exemplifying the robustness and viability of the proposed package. MathFeature has advanced in the area by bringing descriptors not available in other packages, as well as allowing non-experts to use feature extraction techniques.}",

    abstract = "Machine learning methods have been widely used to identify and classify different families of non-coding RNAs. Many of these methods are based on supervised learning, where some previous known attributes, called features, are extracted from a sequence, and then used in a classifier. In this work, we present two methods to identify the two main classes of snoRNAs, C/D box and H/ACA box: snoReport 2.0, a significant improvement of the original snoReport version; and snoRNA-EDeN, a new method based on EDeN, a decompositional graph kernel. On one hand, snoReport 2.0 is a method that, using features extracted from candidate sequences in genomes, combines secondary structure prediction with Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify C/D box and H/ACA box snoRNAs. H/ACA box snoRNA classifier showed a F-score of 93{\%} (an improvement of 10\% regarding to the previous version), while C/D box snoRNA classifier a F-Score of 94\% (improvement of 14\%). Besides, both classifiers exhibited performance measures above 90\%. In the validation phase, snoReport 2.0 predicted 67.43\% of vertebrate organisms for both classes. SnoReport 2.0 predicted: for Nematodes, 29.6\% of C/D box and 69\% of H/ACA box snoRNAs; and for Drosophilids, 3.2\% of C/D box and 76.7\% of H/ACA box snoRNAs. These results show that snoReport 2.0 is efficient to identify snoRNAs in vertebrates, and also H/ACA box snoRNAs in invertebrates organisms. On the other hand, instead of using known features from a sequence (difficult to find in general), a recent approach in machine learning is described as follows. Given a region of interest of a sequence, the objective is to generate a sparse vector that can be used as micro-features in a specific machine learning algorithm, or it can be used to create powerful features. This approach is used in EDeN (Explicit Decomposition with Neighbourhoods), a decompositional graph kernel based on Neighborhood Subgraph Pairwise Distance Kernel (NSPDK). EDeN transforms one graph in a sparse vector, decomposing it in all pairs of neighborhood subgraphs of small radius at increasing distances. Based on EDeN, we developed a method called snoRNA-EDeN. On the test phase, for C/D box snoRNAs, snoRNA-EDeN showed a F-score of 93.4\%, while for H/ACA box snoRNAs, the F-score was 72\%. On the validation phase, for C/D box snoRNAs, snoRNA-EDeN showed a better capacity of generalization, predicting 94.61\% of vertebrate C/D box snoRNAs and 63.52\% of invertebrates, a significantly better result compared to snoReport 2.0, which predicted only 52.92\% of vertebrates and 14.6\% of invertebrates. For H/ACA box snoRNAs, snoReport 2.0 predicted 79.9\% of vertebrate snoRNAs and 73.3\% of Nematode and Drosophilid sequences, while snoRNA-EDeN predicted 95.4\% of vertebrate snoRNAs and 57.8\% of Nematode and Drosophilid sequences.

abstract = {Context
Many researchers adopting systematic reviews (SRs) have also published papers discussing problems with the SR methodology and suggestions for improving it. Since guidelines for SRs in software engineering (SE) were last updated in 2007, we believe it is time to investigate whether the guidelines need to be amended in the light of recent research.
Objective
To identify, evaluate and synthesize research published by software engineering researchers concerning their experiences of performing SRs and their proposals for improving the SR process.
Method
We undertook a systematic review of papers reporting experiences of undertaking SRs and/or discussing techniques that could be used to improve the SR process. Studies were classified with respect to the stage in the SR process they addressed, whether they related to education or problems faced by novices and whether they proposed the use of textual analysis tools.
Results
We identified 68 papers reporting 63 unique studies published in SE conferences and journals between 2005 and mid-2012. The most common criticisms of SRs were that they take a long time, that SE digital libraries are not appropriate for broad literature searches and that assessing the quality of empirical studies of different types is difficult.
Conclusion
We recommend removing advice to use structured questions to construct search strings and including advice to use a quasi-gold standard based on a limited manual search to assist the construction of search stings and evaluation of the search process. Textual analysis tools are likely to be useful for inclusion/exclusion decisions and search string construction but require more stringent evaluation. SE researchers would benefit from tools to manage the SR process but existing tools need independent validation. Quality assessment of studies using a variety of empirical methods remains a major problem.}

abstract = {Virus replication requires specific interactions with host cells. The replication cycle begins with attachment of viral proteins to host cell receptors. The presence or absence of receptors is an important factor in determining if the cell is permissive for infection. The next step in the virus replication cycle is transfer of the genome into cytosol or nucleoplasm. Some viruses transport just their nucleic acid genomes into the cell while others deliver the entire virion. Once in the cell, virion proteins and genome interact with a variety of cell proteins, nucleic acids, and membranes. Productive replication requires synthesis of viral mRNAs, protein, and genomes. The details of these processes vary widely. However, to be successful a virus must be able to compete with host cell for building materials. For example, as the cell is constantly synthesizing proteins, viral mRNAs must be able to redirect ribosomes to their own mRNAs. Some viruses can shut down cellular transcription and translation to redirect those processes to the production of viral proteins. In contrast DNA viruses have developed methods to induce cell DNA replication and/or cell division to obtain materials necessary for genome synthesis. Viruses pack a lot of information into their relatively small genomes. Most do not have the complex promoters that drive cell transcription nor do they have long noncoding introns in their genes. Viruses that replicate in the nucleus often use alternative splicing to generate families of related mRNAs from a single precursor transcript. In other cases a single transcript may be used to produce multiple proteins by ribosome-mediated processes such as leaky scanning, stop codon suppression, and frame shifting. Once viral building blocks have been synthesized, new virions are assembled and must leave the cell. Again, the details of these processes can vary widely. Some of the simplest viruses can assemble in a test tube, from purified capsid proteins and genomes. More complex viruses use a variety of cell proteins and structures for assembly and release.}

This paper proposes a three-step machine learning methodology to empower process experts with limited knowledge in machine learning: 1) data exploration through clustering, 2) representation of the production systems behaviour through specially structured neural networks and 3) querying this representation through evolutionary algorithms to achieve decision support through online optimization or scenario simulation. The chosen algorithms focus on parameter-light, well-established, general use algorithms in order to lower knowledge requirements for their application.}

abstract = {Ribonucleic acid (RNA) modifications are post-transcriptional chemical composition changes that have a fundamental role in regulating the main aspect of RNA function. Recently, large datasets have become available thanks to the recent development in deep sequencing and large-scale profiling. This availability of transcriptomic datasets has led to increased use of machine learning based approaches in epitranscriptomics, particularly in identifying RNA modifications. In this review, we comprehensively explore machine learning based approaches used for the prediction of 11 RNA modification types, namely, m1A, m6A, m5C, 5hmC, ψ, 2′-O-Me, ac4C, m7G, A-to-I, m2G, and D. This review covers the life cycle of machine learning methods to predict RNA modification sites including available benchmark datasets, feature extraction, and classification algorithms. We compare available methods in terms of datasets, target species, approach, and accuracy for each RNA modification type. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the reviewed approaches and suggest future perspectives.}

abstract = {Occurring at adenine (A) with the consensus motif GAC, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most abundant modifications in RNA, which plays very important roles in many biological processes. The nonuniform distribution of m6A sites across the genome implies that, for better understanding the regulatory mechanism of m6A, it is indispensable to characterize its sites in a genome-wide scope. Although a series of experimental technologies have been developed in this regard, they are both time-consuming and expensive. With the avalanche of RNA sequences generated in the postgenomic age, it is highly desired to develop computational methods to timely identify their m6A sites. In view of this, a predictor called “iRNA-Methyl” is proposed by formulating RNA sequences with the “pseudo dinucleotide composition” into which three RNA physiochemical properties were incorporated. Rigorous cross-validation tests have indicated that iRNA-Methyl holds very high potential to become a useful tool for genome analysis. For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a web-server for iRNA-Methyl has been established at http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/iRNA-Methyl by which users can easily get their desired results without needing to go through the mathematical details.}

ABSTRACT = {Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) constitute an important set of transcripts produced in the cells of organisms. Among them, there is a large amount of a particular class of long ncRNAs that are difficult to predict, the so-called long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs), which might play essential roles in gene regulation and other cellular processes. Despite the importance of these lincRNAs, there is still a lack of biological knowledge and, currently, the few computational methods considered are so specific that they cannot be successfully applied to other species different from those that they have been originally designed to. Prediction of lncRNAs have been performed with machine learning techniques. Particularly, for lincRNA prediction, supervised learning methods have been explored in recent literature. As far as we know, there are no methods nor workflows specially designed to predict lincRNAs in plants. In this context, this work proposes a workflow to predict lincRNAs on plants, considering a workflow that includes known bioinformatics tools together with machine learning techniques, here a support vector machine (SVM). We discuss two case studies that allowed to identify novel lincRNAs, in sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) and in maize (Zea mays). From the results, we also could identify differentially-expressed lincRNAs in sugarcane and maize plants submitted to pathogenic and beneficial microorganisms.},

Its application to complete genomic sequences as well as whole transcriptomes is therefore desirable but hindered by extremely high computational costs.Results: We present a novel linear-time, alignment-free method for comparing and clustering RNAs according to sequence and structure. The approach scales to datasets of hundreds of thousands of sequences. The quality of the retrieved clusters has been benchmarked against known ncRNA datasets and is comparable to state-of-the-art sequence–structure methods although achieving speedups of several orders of magnitude. A selection of applications aiming at the detection of novel structural ncRNAs are presented. Exemplarily, we predicted local structural elements specific to lincRNAs likely functionally associating involved transcripts to vital processes of the human nervous system. In total, we predicted 349 local structural RNA elements.Availability: The GraphClust pipeline is available on request.Contact:backofen@informatik.uni-freiburg.deSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

We have completed the first phase of synchronising microRNA families in Rfam and miRBase, creating 356 new Rfam families and updating 40. We established a procedure for comprehensive annotation of viral RNA families starting with Flavivirus and Coronaviridae RNAs. We have also increased the coverage of bacterial and metagenome-based RNA families from the ZWD database. These developments have enabled a significant growth of the database, with the addition of 759 new families in Rfam 14. To facilitate further community contribution to Rfam, expert users are now able to build and submit new families using the newly developed Rfam Cloud family curation system.

However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the landscape of snoRNA cellular functionality is much broader than it once seemed with novel members, non-uniform expression patterns, new and diverse targets as well as several emerging non-canonical functions ranging from the modulation of alternative splicing to the regulation of chromatin architecture. In order to facilitate the further characterization of human snoRNAs in a holistic manner, we introduce an online interactive database tool: snoDB. Its purpose is to consolidate information on human snoRNAs from different sources such as sequence databases, target information, both canonical and non-canonical from the literature and from high-throughput RNA–RNA interaction datasets, as well as high-throughput sequencing data that can be visualized interactively.}",
