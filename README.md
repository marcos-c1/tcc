# Feature extraction in snoRNAs using mathematical approach 

The number of biological sequences available has increased significantly in recent years due to several scientific discoveries about the genetic code that composes living beings, creating a huge volume of data. Consequently, new computational methods were shaped to analyze and extract information from these genetic sequences. The learning methods (AM) have shown wide applicability in bioinformatics and proven to be essential for the selection of useful information from the secondary structures of genomes by perfecting his techniques based on the mathematical archetype in contrast to the model biological standard of analysis. Therefore, this work aims to analyze the mathematical models for feature extraction, mainly extraction techniques that were verified efficient in classifying C/D box snoRNAs in vertebrate and invertebrate organisms with an F-score of 98% and in classifier snoRNAs as H/ACA box with an F-score of 95%. Algorithms such as Fourier Numerical Transformation and Complex Networks reached a greater than 90% rate in classifying C/D box and H/ACA box snoRNAs in genetics sequences of Homo Sapiens, Platypus, Gallus gallus, Nematodes, Drosophila and Leishmania proving to be promising in non-coding RNA (ncRNA) molecules of the class of snoRNAs.
